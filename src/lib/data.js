After having at TORSH, however, I hardly did anything tech-related except for develop and deploy a few websites for my musician friends`,
      `I've worked in React, Angular, Meteor, Svelte, Node.js, Express, KeystoneJS, MongoDB, MySQL, Prisma, Drizzle, Bootstrap, & Tailwind, to name a few. As of lately, most of my experience has been cosummed in honing in my frontend development skillset using Framer Motion & Gsap, often in tandem.`,
